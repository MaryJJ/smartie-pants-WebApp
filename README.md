# Smartie Pants Placements

Smartie Pants Placements is a project to manage placements in [Unity](https://unity.com/) plataform, the system allows us to access information through a REST API.

Basic Actions:

- Create a user and login.
- Create and update placements in Unity.
- Visualize the response from Unity API after creating or updating placements.

This project is a Angular 9 app and works as a visual client for [Smartie Pants Placements Api](https://github.com/MaryJJ/smartie-pants-API)

## Developing

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MaryJJ/smartie-pants-WebApp.git
```

### Initial Configuration

Configure the environment variable serverUrl with the API url.

```sh
src/environments/environment.ts - development environment
src/environments/environment.prod.ts - production environment

Example
serverUrl: 'https://localhost:5001/api'
```

## Getting started

1. Go to project folder and install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Launch development server, and open `localhost:4200` in your browser:

```sh
npm start
```

## Deploying/Publishing

Automatic deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions):
